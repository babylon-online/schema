# Schema
This is the official repository for schemas describing data contributed to [babylon-online.org](http://babylon-online.org). Please refer to the different folders readme for further information.

# File types
We only use easily interpretable, non-proprietary file formats. We encourage anyone to use these!
* `.json` is used to describe objects or save structured data coming from e.g. excel files or foreign databases
* `.jsonld` is used to expose data given in json as linked data and is easily translatable to rdf
* `.xml` is used when we have text which needs complex markup refering to a schema. We do not recommend to use xml for structured objects - this is like puting a table inside a word document
* `.md` or markdown is used for simple text with bold or emphasized elements and structured through headlines (like this document)
* `.csv` for exchanging tabular data
* `.svg` for vector graphics
* `.jpg` and `.png` for compressed images
* `.tif` for uncompressed images

## Markup
Microformats etc.
